# hello-world
This is a repository for my Raspberry Pi Nestbox/Feeder Camera. Most of the code is not my own and mainly taken from different sources from around the web. Feel free to add anything!

My goal is to record video, audio, and temperature data in Eastern Bluebird nestboxes in Oklahoma. I am also interested in implementing the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino microcomputers into other field projects.
